# LLM from Scratch

Welcome to the **LLM from Scratch** project! This repository is designed to help you learn how to build a Large Language Model (LLM) from the ground up. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this project will guide you through the process of creating your own LLM, step by step.

## Project Overview

In this project, we implement a GPT-like model from scratch using PyTorch. The goal is to understand the inner workings of LLMs, including tokenization, attention mechanisms, transformer blocks, and training. By the end of this project, you'll have a fully functional GPT model that can generate text based on a given prompt.

### Key Features:
- **Tokenization**: Learn how to tokenize text using both simple and advanced techniques like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE).
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Implement multi-head self-attention and understand how it powers transformer models.
- **Transformer Blocks**: Build and stack transformer blocks to create a deep neural network capable of understanding and generating text.
- **Training**: Train your model on a dataset and fine-tune it for text generation tasks.
- **Text Generation**: Generate text using your trained model with options for temperature and top-k sampling.

- Advanced text generation techniques

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch
- tiktoken (for tokenization)
- matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch tiktoken matplotlib
```

### Running the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-from-scratch.git
   cd llm-from-scratch
   ```

2. **Explore the Code**:
   - The code is organized into chapters, each focusing on a specific aspect of building an LLM.
   - Start with `chapter02.ipynb` to understand tokenization and move on to subsequent chapters for more advanced topics.

3. **Train the Model**:
   - Use the provided scripts to train your GPT model on a dataset of your choice.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python train.py --dataset your_dataset.txt --epochs 10 --batch_size 4
     ```

4. **Generate Text**:
   - Once trained, you can generate text using the trained model:
     ```bash
     python generate.py --model model.pth --prompt "Every effort moves you"
     ```
